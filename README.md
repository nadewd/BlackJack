# Blackjack 

Blackjack is a popular casino card game played all over the world. In Blackjack, each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a score as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21. When the dealer has served every player, the dealers face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. If a player or the dealer has an ace, and then after hitting receives another ace that would put their score over 21, then that ace that was received, as well as any other future aces received via hits, are now worth 1 rather than 11.

## The Game

Once you land on the webpage the script already deals the player's first two cards and the dealer's first two cards (with one of them faced down). To hit you simply click the "HIT" button, and to stay you click the "STAY" button. Once you stay, the dealer automatically hits or stays using the logic of dealer rules. An important thing to note is to still click "STAY" after reaching 21 so that the dealer's actions can be triggered (they could possibly draw 21 as well).

## Screenshots

I used Figma to design a simple [wireframe](https://imgur.com/a/2kDqeY2) for the Blackjack table

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/r0A4bNh) is the final design of the game (also shows double ace rule)

## Future Plans 
- Add a welcome menu that prompts user to start game
- Change script logic to return to first game state once "PLAY AGAIN" button is clicked rather than reloading the page
- Incorporate more Blackjack rules like betting, insurance, splitting aces, and naturals
- Refine CSS styling of the page
